## Qualifiers
### jobHunter
#### Category 
Business/Productivity
#### Mobile
- jobHunter is a completely new way of approaching the job search experience. It combines the fast paced swiping mechanics of classic dating apps such as Tinder with the professionalism and more serious aspects of LinkedIn. 
- jobHunter is a user driven software. Resumes and job offers are shown to prospective employees and employers and it is only through swiping that anything is accomplished. 
- The app uses Location, Maps, and Push Notifications
#### Story
- The app's story is pretty compelling. It allows users to search for employees or jobs in a much more enjoyable way.
- The value of the app is clear. It provides a quicker job hunting experience and shows jobs that the user may not be aware of in their area
#### Market
- The market for this app is enormous. It covers all high schoolers and above looking for work as well as employers looking for new hires. It also provides a huge value to both sides of employment since it forces them to make their profiles easily digestable to fit the "tinder" style of the app. 
#### Habit
- Though the application is habit forming, it is designed to be uninstalled. Job hunters would ideally use it daily to look for potential jobs but once they are employed, the app would lose its value. Employers are the same in that once they find an employee for whatever role they are aiming to fill, the app will remain unused until a job opening appears again. 
#### Scope
- Though a good idea, the scope of this project is currently too large for our three person group to accomplish in the month that's left for the course. Even the most stripped down version of the app would take an amount of time that three people simply don't have.

### Calender Sync
#### Mobile
An app like this already exists in some form already. 
App uses: Realtime, Push Notification
#### Story
The app is focused on properly syncing schedules. It's very valuable for all sized teams.
#### Market
The app targets teams of all sizes. For managers specifically, the value is huge.
#### Habit
The app is very habit forming. Users access it to both check what obligations they have coming up and to set up future ones. 
#### Scope
The idea is simple but it isn't exactly unique. It can be done in what's left of the semester. The realtime syncing of multiple calenders may be a bit of a struggle

### Annoying Alarm
Category: Productivity / Lifestyle
Mobile: 'Alarm application' would mainly be used on mobile/ smart watches. The application uses audio, push notifications, and real-time.
Story: The application is used to help break the bad habit of snoozing alarms and missing cruicial meetings.
Market: Anyone that needs an alarm.
Habit: Since alarms are used everyday, this app has the potential to be used every day.
Scope: 'Alarm app' is not too complex. At its core, it would need 3 sections, 1 for creating alarm times, another for the clock, and finally one for the games that the users are required to play.
